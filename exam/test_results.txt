TESTING THE DIAGONALIZATION OF A RANK 1 UPDATE
-----------------------------------------------
We diagonalize random matrices of different sizes.
The difference between the computed eigenvalues and the exact eigenvalues is determined (should be close to 0).
Size = 2:	Error = 0
Size = 4:	Error = 0
Size = 8:	Error = 0
Size = 10:	Error = 0
Size = 50:	Error = 0
Size = 100:	Error = 0

We call the method with various special cases

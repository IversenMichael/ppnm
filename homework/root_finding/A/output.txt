We consider the following non-linear set of equations:
(sin(x - y), cos(z^2 + y), x*tan(z) - y^2) = (0, 0, 0)
Newton's method succeeded in 677 iterations
The root to this function is
      10.8      -1.81       9.72 
Inserting this point, the left hand side of the non-linear equations yield:
  -4.9e-16   8.68e-12  -4.05e-09 

Next, we consider the RosenBrocks valley function:
f(x, y) = (1 - x)^2 + 100*(y - x^2)^2
Newton's method succeeded in 84 iterations
The root to the Rosenbrock's valley function is
         1          1 
The function value at this point is
  5.39e-10  -2.58e-12

Integral of f(x, y) = x*y from 0 to 1 along both x and y is equal to 0.25
Using monte carlo integration, we find I = 0.249845924695136
With integration error = 0.000220371697570794
Integral of f(x, y, z) = 1/(1 - cos(x)*cos(y)*cos(z))*1/PI^3 from 0 to PI along all directions is equal to 1.393
Using monte carlo integration, we find I = 1.38584206051136
With integration error = 0.00528945849792613
